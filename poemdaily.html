    <p>
      The dead bird, color of a bruise,<br>
      and smaller than an eye<br>
      swollen shut,<br>
      is king among omens.<br>
      Who can blame the ants for feasting?<br>
      Let him cast the first crumb.<br>
      We once tended the oracles.<br>
        Now we rely on a photograph<br>
        a fingerprint<br>
        a hand we never saw <br>
        coming.<br>
        A man draws a chalk outline <br>
        first in his mind <br>
        around nothing<br>
        then around the body<br>
        of another man.<br>
        He does this without thinking.<br>
        What can I do about the white room I left<br>
        behind? What can I do about the great stones<br>
        I walk among now? What can I do<br>
        but sing.<br>
        Even a small cut can sing all day.<br>
        There are entire nights<br>
        I would take back.<br>
        Nostalgia is a thin moon,<br>
        disappearing<br>
        into a sky like cold,<br>
        unfeeling iron.<br>
        I dreamed<br>
        you were a <button id="poem">  drowned</button> man, crown<br>
        of phosphorescent, seaweed in your hair,<br>
        water in your shoes. I woke up desperate<br>
        for air.<br>
        In another dream, I was a field<br>
        and you combed through me<br>
        searching for something<br>
        you only thought you had lost.<br>
        What have we left at the altar of sorrow?<br>
        What blessed thing will we leave tomorrow?<br>
